  # This can be useful for automatic firewalling,  building block lists, 
  # replicating "snortsam" functionality, etc.  See the "tools/external"
  # directory for example routines that use this feature.
  #
  # If this option is enabled, any rule that has the metadata of "meer 
  # external" (ie - metadata:meer external) will cause the external script 
  # to be executed.  Execution can also be controlled by Snort metadata
  # "policies".

    # Currently only Snort rules have these types of polices.  This can be
    # useful when you want to execute an external script that will to "block"
    # or "firewall" based off the policy types.  This section only applies if
    # you are using Suricata with Snort rules.  Snort's polices are
    # below:

    # connectivity-ips  - You run a lot of real time applications (VOIP, 
    # financial transactions, etc), and don't want to run any rules that 
    # could affect the current performance of your sensor.  The rules in this 
    # category make snort happy, additionally this category focuses on the high
    # profile most likely to affect the largest number of people type of
    # vulnerabilities.

    # balanced-ips - You are normal, you run normal stuff and you want normal
    # security protections.  This is the best policy to start from if you are 
    # new, old, or just plain average.  If you don't have any special
    # requirements for super high speeds or super secure networks start here.

    # security-ips - You don't care about dropping your bosses email, everything
    # in your environment is tightly regulated and you don't tolerate people 
    # stepping outside of your security policy.  This policy hates on IM, P2P,
    # vulnerabilities, malware, web apps that cause productivity loss, remote
    # access, and just about anything not related to getting work done.  
    # If you run your network with an iron fist start here.
