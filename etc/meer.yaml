    # If "dns" is enabled, Meer will do reverse DNS (PTR) lookups of an IP. 
    # The "dns_cache" is the amount of time Meer should "cache" a PTR record

    # already looked up PTR record.  This reduces overloading DNS servers.

    # "health" checks are a set of signatures that are triggered every so 
    # often to ensure a sensor is up and operational.  When these events
    # are triggered,  they are not stored into the database as normal alert
    # data.  For example,  with MySQL/MariaDB output enabled, they update the 
    # "sensor.health" table with the current epoch time.  Think of these
    # events like a "ping" for your sensor.  This can be useful for detecting
    # when Meer, Suricata or Sagan have "died" unexpectedly.
